check which rows, lines and diagonals can still be used to make 5 straights(not blocked) 
for both black and white
not in a static sense (that would be trivial !!! !!! !!!)
but considering that the board squares can be rotated

THE BAD

does not check imminent victories or defeats 
(
the Minimax can avoid these to a certain extent
if there is a known pattern that = victory, it can be 
used together with other heristics
)

does not consider "play canceling" 
(when many possibilities are blocked in current rotation and the
opponent always cancels the rotation with it's inverse we endup
considering possibilities that will never occur)

THE GOOD

long term planning 
(just like tempi for example. 
does not goes towards a victory but tries to keep the odds in favor)

considers the entire board 

compatible - can be given a certain "weight"(importance) and used with other heuristics
